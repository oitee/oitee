🙋🏼‍♂️ I am **Oitihjya Sen**, a lawyer-turned programmer from India. 

🖥️ I am currently attending the Winter '22 batch of the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/), New York.

👩🏼‍⚖️ I have previously worked as a [**Research Fellow**](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/team/oitihjya-sen/) at India’s [leading legal think tank](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/) (2019-21), where I contributed towards [modernizing India’s bankruptcy legal framework](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Report-on-Pre-Packaged-Insolvency-Resolution.pdf).

Here are some of the projects I have built so far: 

 - 🪄 A [per-user URL shortener](https://twirl.otee.dev) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/twirl)),
- 🤖 A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cardimomT) that aggregates blog posts from RSS and Atom feeds and publishes them on Twitter ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/cardimom)),  
- 💱 A simple [Lisp interpreter](https://otee.dev/2021/08/24/crisp-a-simple-lisp-interpreter.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/crisp)), 
- 🔎 Implementation of [Search Relevance using BM25 algorithm](https://otee.dev/2021/11/24/search-relevance-using-bm-25.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/bm25)), 
- ⏲️ A meeting scheduler that handles time-slot conflicts ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/meetings)), and
- ✍ A [technical blog](https://otee.dev/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/oitee.github.io))

📚 I have written over **40 posts** on my tech blog, on various topics ranging from [OAuth framework](https://otee.dev/2021/12/27/understanding-oauth.html), [higher-order functions](https://otee.dev/2021/07/11/higher-order-functions.html), [JavaScript Promises](https://otee.dev/2021/11/10/javascript-promises.html) to [cache replacement policies](https://otee.dev/2021/08/18/cache-replacement-policy.html) and [lazy sequences in Clojure](https://otee.dev/2022/01/17/lazy-clojure.html). My articles have been featured on [Clojure Deref](https://clojure.org/news/2022/01/21/deref), [JavaScript in Plain English](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/making-short-links-shorter-using-nginx-custom-domain-44d2637fb329), and the Recurse Center’s [Joy of Computing Blog](https://joy.recurse.com/posts/1446-who-moved-my-cheese-laziness-in-clojure).

👓 I am deeply fascinated by functional programming. I am currently teaching myself Clojure.
